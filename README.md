# Tech-Module-September-2016

## This repository keeps my work during the programming fundamentals course in Software Unitiversity.

- Programming Fundamentals - keeps the solutions for all the exercises and exams which I have done during the course.
- Software Technologies - keeps the solutions for building simple blogs using different technologies - C#, JavaScript, Java, PHP.
- Practical Project - keeps the solution of my final project for the course. It represents a more complicated blog in comparison with the others which we have build during the course.
